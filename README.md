Easygui3
I am currently working on making a 3rd version of the defunct Easygui(easygui2) I will be adding two key new features which are color and size. You can check the development branch for any new progress, once we have the new features I will then release it. 

Developer help would be greatly appreceated, please pm me on Freenode IRC, my username is austinprog. 

#Due to school, I will not have much time to contirbute to this project until breaks.

Thank you to the original developers of easygui, and the developer of easygui2, I found some features I personally would find benificial and wil thus call it EasyGui3.
